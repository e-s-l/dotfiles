# dotfiles

- started for vim ie the file ~/.vimrc based on internet recommendations, happy tih current set-up
- simliarly added a tmux: this needs more work
-  added a bashrc and aliases file basically copied from FS, needs work

******************

Write a install bash script that copies (or creates symbolic links) all the dot files to the right places.

Get list of apt packages installed (which have corresponding dotfiles). Then use this list create install.sh
